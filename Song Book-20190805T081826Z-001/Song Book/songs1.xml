of the coming of the Lord;

His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.</Body>

His name is all my trust,
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne, His promise stands,
And He can well secure
What I&apos;ve commited to His hands,
Till the decisive hour.

Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father&apos;s face;
And in the New Jerusalem.

Singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary

Many arrows pierce my soul
From without, within;

Through Him I must win.

Oh I want to see Him, look upon His face,
There to sing forever, of His saving Grace;
On the streets of Glory let my lift my voice;

Dark may be the night,
But i&apos;ll cling more close to him,
He will give me light,
Satans snares may vex my soul,
Turn my thoughts aside,
But my Lord goes ahead,
Leads whate&apos;er betide.

When in valleys low I look,
Tward the mountain hieght,
And behold my saviour there,
Leading in the fight,
With a tender hand outstreched,
Tward the valley low,
Guiding me I can see as I onward go.

When before me billows rise,
From the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my barque,
He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on,
Through this world below,
He&apos;s a real friend to me,
O I love Him so.</Body>

The emblem of suffering and shame

Till my trophies at last I lay down

And exchange it some day for a crown

So despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear Lamb of God
Left his glory above 
To bear it to dark Calvary

In that old rugged cross
Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see 
For &apos;twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me 

To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true
It&apos;s shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he&apos;ll call me some day
To my home far away
Where his glory forever I&apos;ll share</Body>

His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die,

That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow,

And there proclaim,

As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life&apos;s dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow&apos;s tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When Jesus comes for me,
In power and majesty,
To take me home.
Blest saviour, then in love,
Fear and distrust remove,
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.</Body>

Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He&apos;ll prepare for us a place.

CHORUS
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We&apos;ll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when trav&apos;ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev&apos;ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we&apos;ll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.</Body>

As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I&apos;m rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I&apos;m as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There&apos;s no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they&apos;ve taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!</Body>

This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all-
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied;
For ev&apos;ry sin on Him was laid-
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin&apos;s curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine-
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death-
This is the pow&apos;r of Christ in me;
From life&apos;s first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow&apos;r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home-
Here in the pow&apos;r of Christ I&apos;ll stand.</Body>

<Title>I Have Returned</Title>

<Key></Key>

<Body>I have returned 
to the God of my childhood,
To the same simple faith
as a child I once knew;
Like the prodigal son
I have longed 
for my loved ones,
For the comforts of home
and the God I outgrew.

I have returned
to the God of my childhood,
Bethlehem&apos;s Babe,
the prophet&apos;s Messiah;
He&apos;s Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
With unfailing faith
for the child of her heart;
She said bring them up
the way that you want them, 
Thank God when they&apos;re grown,
they&apos;ll never depart.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
I learned at her knee
He&apos;s the lily of the valley; 
He&apos;s Jesus to me,
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my father,
The most God-like man
a child could know;
I just heard a shout
from the angels in glory,
Praising the Lord 
a child has come home.

I have returned 
to the God of my father,
Creator of heaven and earth, 
God of the universe;
He&apos;s Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned 
to the Yahweh of Judah,
On my knees I did fall 
where the wall now stands;
This lesson I learned 
as I&apos;ve worked my way homeward,
The Saviour of all 
is a comfort to man. 

I have returned 
to the Father of Abraham, 
The shepherd of Moses 
who called Him the great I am; 
He&apos;s Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity; 
Praise His name, 
I have returned.</Body>

On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e&apos;er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

His dying crimson, like a robe,
Spreads o&apos;er His body on the tree;
Then I am dead to all the globe,
And all the globe is dead to me.

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.</Body>

<Body>Do you know what it is 
not to have one guilty feeling, 
Not to wonder where you&apos;re
going when you die;
Not condemned of the past, 
Not afraid of what 
tomorrow holds in store
And know the reason why?

Yes, that&apos;s just how it is 
when you go down in the water
&apos;Cause by faith you believe in 
what you heard,
It&apos;s no impossible dream,
you can start over clean
When you&apos;re washed
by the water of the Word.

Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?
Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?

It&apos;s like being born again 
with a whole new life to live,
Never having to look back 
to what you&apos;ve been,
&apos;Cause according to the Lord,
You&apos;ve just started your existence,
And where He&apos;s concerned 
there never was no sin;

For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner
But a saint who&apos;s been washed
white as snow;
Not by any thing we&apos;ve done
But by the blood of God&apos;s own Son.
Are you washed by the 
water of the Word?

Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?
Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?

Yes, I&apos;m washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word.
Yes, I&apos;m washed by the water,

The camel train comes in.

Now the blessed Holy Spirit
From the Father God above,
Has come down to earth
To claim His worthy bride.
And our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared his tents of love,
And he wants his fair Rebecca by his side.

We have left our kin folks gladly,
We have bid the world good-bye,
We are going to our home beyond the sky.
We shall soon behold our Isaac,
In our home beyond the sky,
What a happy, happy wedding that will be.

That will be a joyful meeting, 
When the camel train comes in,
Where our Isaac waits 
To meet his happy bride;
What a holy consummation,
What a glorious jubilee,
When we see the fair Rebecca by his side.</Body>

Then I trembled at the law I&apos;d spurned,
Till my guilty soul, imploring turned
To Calvary.

Now I&apos;ve given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King, 
Now my raptured soul can only sing,
Of Calvary.

CHORUS
How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be,
How marvelous! How wonderful!
Is my saviors love for me.

For me it was in the garden,
He prayed not my will, but thine.
He had no tears for his own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld him,
And came from the world of light.
To comfort him in his sorrows,
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them his very own.
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory,
His face I at last shall see.
Twill be my joy through the ages,
To sing of his love for me.</Body>

CHORUS
Trust and obey,
For there&apos;s no other way,
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But his smile quickly drives it away,
Not a doubt not a fear,
Not a sigh not a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay,
Not a grief not a loss,
Not a frown not a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove,
the delights of His love,
untill all on the alter we lay,
For the favour He shows,
and the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet,
we will sit at His feet,
Or we&apos;ll walk by His side in the way,
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear only trust and obey.</Body>

<Body>Here among the shadows living in a lonely land,
With strangers we&apos;re a band of pilgrams on the move,
Thru dangers burdened down with sorrows,
And we&apos;re shunned on every hand,
But we are looking for a city built above.

CHORUS
O yes we&apos;re looking for a city,
Where we&apos;ll never die,
There the sainted millions never say goodbye,
There we&apos;ll meet our saviour,
And our loved ones too,
Come O holy spirit,
All our hopes renew.

Here in dissapointment often we so sadly roam,
And earthly friends no longer speak one word of love,
But truly we have found contentment 
Jesus promised us a home,
So we are looking for a city  built above.

In this land of dangers we are going here and there,
We&apos;re simply trusting in the blessed saviours love,
And mercy tho we may be strangers 
Living in this world of care,
We&apos;re always looking for a city built above.</Body>

O what a tender compassionate friend,
He met the need of my heart.
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart.

CHORUS
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
When at the cross,
The saviour made me whole,
My sins were washed away,
And my night was turned to day,
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Born of the spirit with life from above,
Into Gods family divine,
Justified fully through Calvary&apos;s love,
O what a standing is mine,
And the transaction so quickly was made,
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace he did proffer,
He saved me praise His deer name.

Now I&apos;ve a hope that will surely endure,
after the passing of time,
I have a future in heaven for sure,
there in those mansions sublime 
And it&apos;s because of that wonderful day,
When at the cross I believed,
Riches eternal and blessings supernal,
From His precvious hand I recieve.</Body>

Whether great or small,

Resting &apos;neath His shelt&apos;ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,

Through waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,

Naked come to thee for dress,
Helpless look to thee for grace,
Foul I to the fountian fly,
Wash me saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.</Body>

So loved He the world that

Who yielded His life 
An atonement for sin,

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,

Oh, come to the Father, 
Through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; 
Great things He hath done.

The purchase of blood,
To every believer 
The promise of God;
The vilest offender 
Who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus 
A pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing 
Through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher,

How the Saviour came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary,
To save a wretch like me,
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious bloods atoning,
Then I repented of my sins,
And won the victory.

CHORUS
Oh victory in Jesus,
My Saviour forever,
He sought me and He bought me,
With His redeeming blood,
He loved me ere and I knew Him,
And all our love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the clensing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing,
How He made the lame to walk again,
And He caused the blind to see,
And then I cryed &quot;Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit&quot;,
And somehow Jesus came,
And brought to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion,
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold,
Beyond the crystal sea,
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day i&apos;ll sing up there,
The song of victory.</Body>

Toils and snares,
I have already come;
&apos;Tis grace hath brought 
Me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we&apos;ve been 
There ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We&apos;ve no less days 
To sing God&apos;s praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God,
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God,</Body>

<Title>Living for Jesus is the Best Life of all</Title>

<Key></Key>

<Body>Living for Jesus is the best life of all,
Serving and following Him,
Living the worldly life is no life at all.
I know it since Jesus came in,
Nothing can satisfy like Jesus within.
He makes my happy heart sing,
Walking the saviours way,
Happy in modern days,
Living for Jesus my king.</Body>

<Body>Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou are the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o&apos;er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me.</Body>

<Title>I am Thine, oh Lord,</Title>

<Key></Key>

<Body>I am Thine, oh Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
Nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
To Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
With a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
And with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
That I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
That I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.</Body>

<Title>Jesus, Keep me Near the Cross,</Title>

<Key></Key>

<Body>Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calvary&apos;s mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o&apos;er me.

Near the cross I&apos;ll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.</Body>

<Title>Abide with me</Title>

<Key></Key>

<Body>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life&apos;s little day;
Earth&apos;s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see-
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter&apos;s pow&apos;r?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death&apos;s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;
Heav&apos;n&apos;s morning breaks, and earth&apos;s vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</Body>

<Title>When they Ring the Golden Bells</Title>

<Key></Key>

<Body>There&apos;s a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore by faith&apos;s decree;
One by one we&apos;ll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

 
Don&apos;t you hear the bells now ringing?
Don&apos;t you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

We shall know no sin or sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing,
Of our Father&apos;s sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

Don&apos;t you hear the bells now ringing?
Don&apos;t you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
And in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit to be free,
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Eden,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.


Don&apos;t you hear the bells now ringing?
Don&apos;t you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.</Body>
