God is not a Man that he Should Lie. 


 

God is not a man, that he should lie; 

Neither the son of man, that he should repent: 

Hath he said, and shall he not do it? 

Or hath he spoken, And shall he not make it good? 

 

Behold I have received commandment to bless: 

And he hath blessed; And I cannot reverse it. 

For God is not a man, that he should lie, 

Neither the son of man that he should repent

But to wait in prayer 

For an answer from you.

They that wait upon the Lord, 

Shall renew their strength, 

They shall mount up with wings as eagles, 

They shall run and not be weary, 

They shall walk and not faint;

Teach me, Lord, to wait 

While hearts are aflame, 

Help me humble my pride 

And call on Your Name; 

Keep my faith renewed, 

Keep my eyes on thee, 

Help me be on this earth 

What you want me to be.

His truth is marching on. 

 

CHORUS 

Glory! Glory, hallelujah! Glory! Glory, hallelujah! Glory! 

Glory, hallelujah! His Truth is marching on. 

 

 I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps; 

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; 

I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps; 

His day is marching on. 

 

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never sound retreat; 

He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; 

Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! 

Our God is marching on. 

 

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, 

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me; 

As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free; 

While God is marching on.

Before His Father's face; 

And in the New Jerusalem.

As I Journey Through the Land

Dark may be the night, 

But i'll cling more close to him, 

He will give me light, 

Satan’s snares may vex my soul, 

Turn my thoughts aside, 

But my Lord goes ahead, 

Leads whate'er betide. 

 

When in valleys low I look, 

Tward the mountain hieght, 

And behold my saviour there, 

Leading in the fight, 

With a tender hand outstreched, 

Tward the valley low, 

Guiding me I can see as I onward go. 

 

When before me billows rise, 

From the mighty deep, 

Then my Lord directs my barque, 

He doth safely keep, 

And He leads me gently on, 

Through this world below, 

He's a real friend to me, O I love Him so.

Till my trophies at last I lay down

Has a wondrous attraction for me 

For the dear Lamb of God Left his glory above 

To bear it to dark Calvary

A wondrous beauty I see 

For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died 

To pardon and sanctify me

It's shame and reproach gladly bear 

Then he'll call me some day To my home far away 

Where his glory forever I'll share

Angels in robes of light arrayed, 

Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept. 

 

Let me, like Mary, through the gloom, 

Come with a gift to Thee: 

 Show to me now the empty tomb, 

Lead me to Calvary.

How great Thou art, How great Thou art! 

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee;

When through the woods, And forest glades I wander 

And hear the birds, Sing sweetly in the trees; 

When I look down, From lofty mountain grandeur 

And hear the brook And feel the gentle breeze. 

 

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, 

Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in; 

That on the cross, My burden gladly bearing, 

He bled and died, To take away my sin. 

 

When Christ shall come, With shout of acclamation 

And take me home, What joy shall fill my heart! 

Then I shall bow, In humble adoration 

And there proclaim, My God, how great Thou art!

O may my love to Thee 

Pure, warm, and changeless be, 

A living fire! 

 

While life's dark maze I tread, 

And griefs around me spread, 

Be Thou my Guide; 

Bid darkness turn to day, 

Wipe sorrow's tears away, 

Nor let me ever stray 

From Thee aside. 

 

When Jesus comes for me, 

In power and majesty, 

To take me home. 

Blest saviour, then in love, 

Fear and distrust remove, 

O bear me safe above, 

A ransomed soul.

Thy Word declares, Thou wilt supply our need: 

For blessing now, Oh Lord, I humbly plead.

I'm Rejoicing Night and Day, 


 

I'm rejoicing night and day, As I walk the pilgrim way, 

For the hand of God in all my life I see, 

And the reason of my bliss, 

Yes, the secret all is this: That the Comforter abides with me. 

 

CHORUS 

He abides, He abides, 

Hallelujah, He abides with me 

I'm rejoicing night and day, As I walk the narrow way, 

For the Comforter abides with me. 

 

Once my heart was full of sin, Once I had no peace within, 

Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree; 

Then I fell down at His feet, And there came a peace so sweet, 

Now the Comforter abides with me. 

 

He is with me everywhere, And He knows my every care 

I'm as happy as a bird and just as free; 

For the Spirit has control, Jesus satisfies my soul, 

Since the Comforter abides with me! 

 

There's no thirsting for the things Of the world, they've taken wings; 

Long ago I gave them up, and instantly 

All my night was turned to day, All my burdens rolled away, 

Now the Comforter abides with me!

Come, ye That Love the Lord, 


 

Come, ye that love the Lord, 

And let our joys be known, 

Join in a song with sweet accord, 

Join in a song with sweet accord, 

And thus surround the throne, 

And thus surround the throne. 

 

CHORUS 

We're marching to Zion, 

Beautiful, beautiful Zion; 

We're marching upward to Zion, 

The beautiful city of God. 

 

Let those refuse to sing 

Who never knew our God: 

But children of the heav'nly King, 

But children of the heav'nly King, 

Shall speak their joys abroad, 

Shall speak their joys abroad. 

 

The hill of Zion yields 

A thousand sacred sweets 

Before we reach the heav'nly fields, 

 Before we reach the heav'nly fields, 

Or walk the golden streets, 

Or walk the golden streets. 

 

Then let our songs abound, 

And ev'ry tear be dry; 

We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground, 

We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground, 

To fairer worlds on high, 

To fairer worlds on high.

Standing on the Promises of God 


 

Standing on the promises of Christ my king, 

Thru eternal ages let his praises ring, 

Glory in the highest I will shout and sing, 

 Standing on the promises of god. 

 

CHORUS 

Standing, Standing, Standing on the promises of God my savior, 

Standing, Standing, I'm standing on the promises of God. 

 

Standing on the promises that cannot fail, 

When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, 

By the living word of God I shall prevail, 

Standing on the promises of God. 

 

Standing on the promises I now can see, 

Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me, 

Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free, 

Standing on the promises of God. 

 

Standing on the promises I cannot fall, 

Listening every moment to the spirits call, 

Resting in my savior as my all in all, 

Standing on the promises of God.

Homesick

But the reason why im broken 

The reason Why I cry 

Is how long must I wait to be with you

I close my eyes and I see your face 

If home's where my heart is then i'm out of place 

Lord won't you give me strenght 

To make it through somehow 

I've never been more homesick then now 

 

Help me Lord cause i don't understand your ways 

The reason why, i wonder if i'l ever know 

But even if you showed me the hurt would be the same 

 Cause i'm still here so far away from home 

 

In christ there are no goodbyes 

And in christ there is no end 

So I hold on to Jesus with all that I have 

To see you again To see you again

In Christ Alone 


 

In Christ alone my hope is found; 

He is my light, my strength, my song; 

This cornerstone, this solid ground, 

Firm through the fiercest drought and storm. 

 

What heights of love, what depths of peace, 

When fears are stilled, when strivings cease! 

My comforter, my all in all- 

Here in the love of Christ I stand. 

 

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh, 

Fullness of God in helpless babe! 

This gift of love and righteousness, 

Scorned by the ones He came to save. 

 

Till on that cross as Jesus died, 

The wrath of God was satisfied; 

For ev'ry sin on Him was laid- 

Here in the death of Christ I live. 

 

There in the ground His body lay, 

Light of the world by darkness slain; 

Then bursting forth in glorious day, 

Up from the grave He rose again! 

 

And as He stands in victory, 

Sin's curse has lost its grip on me; 

For I am His and He is mine- 

Bought with the precious blood of Christ. 

 

No guilt in life, no fear in death- 

This is the pow'r of Christ in me; 

From life's first cry to final breath, 

Jesus commands my destiny. 

 

No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man, 

Can ever pluck me from His hand; 

Till He returns or calls me home- 

Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.

And bring forth the praises of him

Into his marvelous light

On the wings of a snow white dove 


 

When troubles surround us, and they will come 

the body grows weak and the spirit grows numb 

when these things beset us He doesn't forget us 

He sends down His love on the wings of a dove. 

 

CHORUS 
On the wings of a snow white dove 

God sends his pure sweet love 

a sign from above, on the wings of a dove. 

 

Noah had drifted, on the flood many days 

He searched for land in various ways; 

troubles he had some, but not from above 

God gave him His sign , on the wings of a dove. 

 

Jesus our saviour, came to earth one day; 

He was born in a stable in a manger of hay 

though here rejected but not from above 

God gave us his sign, on the wings of a dove. 

 

When Jesus went down to the waters that day 

he was baptised, in the usual way 

when it was done, God blessed his son, 

He sent Him His love on the wings of a dove.

I Have Returned

To the same simple faith as a child I once knew; 

Like the prodigal son I have longed for my loved ones, 

For the comforts of home and the God I outgrew.

Bethlehem's Babe, the prophet's Messiah; 

He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;

With unfailing faith for the child of her heart;

I learned at her knee He's the lily of the valley; 

He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity; 

Praise His name, I have returned. 

 

I have returned to the God of my father, 

The most God-like man a child could know; 

I just heard a shout from the angels in glory, 

Praising the Lord a child has come home. 

 

I have returned to the God of my father, 

Creator of heaven and earth, God of the universe; 

He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity; 

Praise His name, I have returned. 

 

I have returned to the Yahweh of Judah, 

On my knees I did fall where the wall now stands; 

This lesson I learned as I've worked my way homeward, 

The Saviour of all is a comfort to man. 

 

 I have returned to the Father of Abraham, 

The shepherd of Moses who called Him the great I am; 

He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity; 

Praise His name, I have returned.

When I Survey the Wondrous Cross 


 

When I survey the wondrous cross 

On which the Prince of glory died, 

My richest gain I count but loss, 

And pour contempt on all my pride. 

 

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 

Save in the death of Christ my God! 

All the vain things that charm me most, 

I sacrifice them to His blood. 

 

See from His head, His hands, His feet, 

Sorrow and love flow mingled down! 

Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 

Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 

 

His dying crimson, like a robe, 

Spreads o'er His body on the tree; 

Then I am dead to all the globe, 

And all the globe is dead to me. 

 

Were the whole realm of nature mine, 

That were a present far too small; 

Love so amazing, so divine, 

Demands my soul, my life, my all.

I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;

Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. 

 

Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight; 

Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight; 

Thou my soul's Shelter, Thou my high Tower: 

Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power. 

 

 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise, 

Thou mine Inheritance, now and always: 

Thou and Thou only, first in my heart, 

High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art. 

 

High King of Heaven, my victory won, 

May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Sun! 

Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, 

Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

Are You Washed?(Key of G / Ab) 


 

Do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling, 

Not to wonder where you're going when you die; 

Not condemned of the past, 

 Not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store 

And know the reason why? 

Yes, that's just how it is when you go down in the water ' 

Cause by faith you believe in what you heard, 

It's no impossible dream, you can start over clean 

When you're washed by the water of the Word. 

 

CHORUS 

Are you washed by the water, Washed by the water of the Word? 

Are you washed by the water, Washed by the water of the Word? 

 

It's like being born again with a whole new life to live, 

Never having to look back to what you've been, ' 

Cause according to the Lord, You've just started your existence, 

And where He's concerned there never was no sin; 

 

For when God looks your way He no longer sees a sinner 

But a saint who's been washed white as snow; 

Not by any thing we've done But by the blood of God's own Son. 

 

Yes, I'm washed by the water, Washed by the water of the Word. 

Yes, I'm washed by the water, Washed by the water of the Word.

Breathe that holy name in prayer. 

 

Oh the precious name of Jesus! 

How it thrills our souls with joy, 

When His loving arms receive us, 

And His songs our tongues employ. 

 

At the name of Jesus bowing, 

Falling prostrate at His feet, 

King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him 

When our journey is complete.

To rid my soul of one dark blot, 

To Thee whose blood can cleanse Each spot,

With many a conflict, many a doubt, 

Fightings and fears within, without,

I am bound for the promised land,

O'er all those wide extended plains 

Shines one eternal day; 

There God's own son forever reigns, 

And scatters night away. 

 

No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath, 

Can reach that healthful shore; 

Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, 

Are feared and felt no more.

And be forever blest! 

When shall I see my Father's face, 

And in His bosom rest?

Living Below in This old Sinful World 


 

Living below in this old sinful world, 

Hardly a comfort can afford; 

Striving alone to face temptations sore, 

Where could I go but to the Lord? 

 

CHORUS 

Where could I go, O where could I go? 

Seeking a refuge for my soul? 

Needing a friend to help me in the end, 

Where could I go but to the Lord? 

 

Neighbors are kind, I love them every one, 

We get along in sweet accord; 

But when my soul needs manna from above, 

Where could I go but to the Lord? 

 

Life here is grand, With friends I love so dear, 

Comfort I get from gods own word; 

Yet when I face the chilling hand of death, 

Where could I go but to the Lord?

Praise the Lord today I know I'm free 

He is with me and if I stay close to Him 

Safe from harm and danger I will be.

Cast them in the bottom of the sea. 

Picked me up and turned me round, 

Set my feet on higher ground, 

Now I'm walking happy glad and free.

Is so sweet, The birds hush their singing 

And the melody that he gave to me, 

Within my heart is ringing. 

 

I'd stay in the garden with him, 

Tho the night around me be falling, 

But he bids me go, Through the voice of woe, 

His voice to me is calling.

Eleazer stopped to rest his camel train, 

He had found a bride for Isaac, He had found Rebecca fair, 

And his weary journey had not been in vain.

So get ready evening shadows fall, Can't you hear the Eleazer call? 

There is going to be a wedding, Our joy will soon begin. 

In the evening when, The camel train comes in. 

 

 Now the blessed Holy Spirit From the Father God above, 

Has come down to earth To claim His worthy bride. 

And our Isaac over yonder Has prepared his tents of love, 

And he wants his fair Rebecca by his side. 

 

We have left our kin folks gladly, We have bid the world good-bye, 

We are going to our home beyond the sky. 

We shall soon behold our Isaac, In our home beyond the sky, 

What a happy, happy wedding that will be.

For the master called to them Come and dine. 

There they found their hearts desire, Bread and fish upon the fire 

Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.

O 'twill be a glorious sight, All the saints in spotless white 

And with Jesus they shall feast eternally.

Caring not my Lord was crucified,

Till my guilty soul, imploring turned To Calvary.

And wonder how he could love me, A sinner condemned unclean. 

 

CHORUS 

How marvelous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be, 

How marvelous! How wonderful! Is my saviors love for me. 

 

For me it was in the garden, He prayed not my will, but thine. 

He had no tears for his own griefs, But sweat drops of blood for mine. 

 

In pity angels beheld him, And came from the world of light. 

To comfort him in his sorrows, He bore for my soul that night. 

 

He took my sins and my sorrows, He made them his very own. 

He bore the burden to Calvary, And suffered and died alone. 

 

When with the ransomed in glory, His face I at last shall see. 

Twill be my joy through the ages, To sing of his love for me.

Trust and obey, For there's no other way, 

To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey. 

 

Not a shadow can rise, Not a cloud in the skies, 

But his smile quickly drives it away, 

Not a doubt not a fear, Not a sigh not a tear, 

Can abide while we trust and obey. 

 

Not a burden we bear, Not a sorrow we share, 

But our toil He doth richly repay, 

Not a grief not a loss, Not a frown not a cross, 

But is blest if we trust and obey. 

 

But we never can prove, the delights of His love, 

until all on the alter we lay, 

For the favour He shows, and the joy He bestows, 

Are for them who will trust and obey. 

 

Then in fellowship sweet, we will sit at His feet, 

Or we'll walk by His side in the way, 

What He says we will do, Where He sends we will go, 

Never fear only trust and obey.

And earthly friends no longer speak one word of love,

Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me 


 

Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee; 

Let the water and the blood, From Thy wounded side which flowed, 

Be of sin the double cure, Save from wrath and make me pure. 

 

Could my tears forever flow, Could my zeal no languor know, 

These for sin could not atone; Thou must save, and Thou alone: 

In my hand no price I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling. 

 

Not the labours of my hands, Can fulfil thy laws demands, 

Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, 

All for sin could not atone, Thou must save and thou alone. 

Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to thy cross I cling, 

 

Naked come to thee for dress, Helpless look to thee for grace, 

Foul I to the fountian fly, Wash me saviour, or I die. 

While I draw this fleeting breath, When my eyes shall close in death, 

When I rise to worlds unknown, And behold Thee on Thy throne, 

Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.

CHORUS 

Oh victory in Jesus, My Saviour forever, 

He sought me and He bought me, With His redeeming blood, 

He loved me ere and I knew Him, And all our love is due Him, 

He plunged me to victory, Beneath the clensing flood. 

 

I heard about His healing, Of His cleansing power revealing, 

How He made the lame to walk again, And He caused the blind to see, 

And then I cryed "Dear Jesus, Come and heal my broken spirit", 

And somehow Jesus came, And brought to me the victory. 

 

I heard about a mansion, He has built for me in glory, 

And I heard about the streets of gold, Beyond the crystal sea, 

About the angels singing, And the old redemption story, 

And some sweet day i'll sing up there, The song of victory.

Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness; 

Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory? 

I triumph still, if Thou abide with me. 

 

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes; 

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies; 

Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee; 

In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

When they Ring the Golden Bells 


 

There's a land beyond the river, 

That we call the sweet forever, 

And we only reach that shore by faith's decree; 

One by one we'll gain the portals, 

There to dwell with the immortals, 

When they ring the golden bells for you and me. 

 

CHORUS 

Don't you hear the bells now ringing? 

Don't you hear the angels singing? 

Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee, 

In that far-off sweet forever, 

Just beyond the shining river, 

When they ring the golden bells for you and me. 

 

We shall know no sin or sorrow, 

In that haven of tomorrow, 

When our barque shall sail beyond the silver sea; 

We shall only know the blessing, 

Of our Father's sweet caressing, 

When they ring the golden bells for you and me. 

 

When our days shall know their number, 

And in death we sweetly slumber, 

When the King commands the spirit to be free, 

Nevermore with anguish laden, 

We shall reach that lovely Eden, 

When they ring the golden bells for you and me.
