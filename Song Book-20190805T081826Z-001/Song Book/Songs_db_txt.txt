I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom

let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.|2005-03-13T10:13:54|MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY

Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see 
For 'twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died

Then he'll call me some day
To my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share|2005-03-13T10:14:52|ON A HILL FAR AWAY ON A HILL FAR AWAY

By the Savior's side?
Are you washed in the blood 
Of the Lamb?
Do you rest each 
Moment in the Crucified?

Lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary.|2005-03-13T10:13:13|KING OF MY LIFE I CROWN THEE NOW, KING OF MY LIFE I CROWN THEE NOW,

Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art,

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
Thou art!|2010-01-03T12:45:48|OH LORD MY GOD! OH LORD MY GOD!

My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When Jesus comes for me,
In power and majesty,
To take me home.
Blest saviour, then in love,
Fear and distrust remove,
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.|2005-03-13T10:14:00|MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE,

Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

Onward to the prize before us!

Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.|2005-03-13T10:15:39|SING THE WONDROUS LOVE OF JESUS, SING THE WONDROUS LOVE OF JESUS,

And set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing 
Me from sin:
Fulfill Thy Word, and make me 
Pure within:
Fill me with fire where once 
I burned with shame:
Grant my desire to magnify 
Thy name.

Lord take my life, and make it 
Wholly Thine:
Fill my poor heart with 
Thy great love divine;
Take all my will, my passion, 
Self and pride;
I now surrender: Lord in me abide.

From Thee:
Send a revival,

As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!|2005-03-13T10:12:02|I'M REJOICING NIGHT AND DAY, I'M REJOICING NIGHT AND DAY,

We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God:
But children of the heav'nly King,
But children of the heav'nly King,
Shall speak their joys abroad,
Shall speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
And ev'ry tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.|2005-06-12T12:12:24|COME, YE THAT LOVE THE LORD, COME, YE THAT LOVE THE LORD,

I close my eyes and I see your face
If home's where my heart is then i'm out of place
Lord won't you give me strenght 
To make it through somehow
I've never been more homesick then now

Help me Lord cause i don't understand your ways
The reason why, i wonder if i'l ever know
But even if you showed me the hurt would be the same
Cause i'm still here so far away from home

In christ there are no goodbyes
And in christ there is no end
So I hold on to Jesus with all that I have
To see you again
To see you again|2010-02-07T12:06:08|HOMESICK YOUR IN A BETTER PLACE

He is my light, my strength, my song;
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all-
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied;
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid-
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine-
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death-
This is the pow'r of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home-
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.|2009-04-15T18:47:09|IN CHRIST ALONE IN CHRIST ALONE MY HOPE IS FOUND;

to the God of my childhood,
To the same simple faith
as a child I once knew;
Like the prodigal son
I have longed 
for my loved ones,
For the comforts of home
and the God I outgrew.

I have returned
to the God of my childhood,
Bethlehem's Babe,
the prophet's Messiah;
He's Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name,

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
With unfailing faith
for the child of her heart;
She said bring them up
the way that you want them, 
Thank God when they're grown,
they'll never depart.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
I learned at her knee
He's the lily of the valley; 
He's Jesus to me,
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my father,
The most God-like man
a child could know;
I just heard a shout
from the angels in glory,
Praising the Lord 
a child has come home.

I have returned 
to the God of my father,
Creator of heaven and earth, 
God of the universe;
He's Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned 
to the Yahweh of Judah,
On my knees I did fall 
where the wall now stands;
This lesson I learned 
as I've worked my way homeward,
The Saviour of all 
is a comfort to man. 

I have returned 
to the Father of Abraham, 
The shepherd of Moses 
who called Him the great I am;

Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Spreads o'er His body on the tree;

Yes, that's just how it is

Never having to look back 
to what you've been,
'Cause according to the Lord,
You've just started your existence,
And where He's concerned 
there never was no sin;

For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner
But a saint who's been washed
white as snow;
Not by any thing we've done
But by the blood of God's own Son.

The camel train comes in.

Now the blessed Holy Spirit
From the Father God above,
Has come down to earth
To claim His worthy bride.
And our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared his tents of love,
And he wants his fair Rebecca by his side.

We have left our kin folks gladly,
We have bid the world good-bye,
We are going to our home beyond the sky.
We shall soon behold our Isaac,
In our home beyond the sky,
What a happy, happy wedding that will be.

That will be a joyful meeting, 
When the camel train comes in,
Where our Isaac waits 
To meet his happy bride;
What a holy consummation,
What a glorious jubilee,
When we see the fair Rebecca by his side.|2005-03-13T10:12:24|IT WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING, IT WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING,
SO GET READY EVENING SHADOWS FALL,
NOW THE BLESSED HOLY SPIRIT
WE HAVE LEFT OUR KIN FOLKS GLADLY,
THAT WILL BE A JOYFUL MEETING,|

Where the saints of God are fed
He invites His chosen people,
Come and dine.
With His manna He doth feed,
And supplies our every need
O 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus
All the time.

CHORUS
Come and dine the master calleth,
Come and dine,
You may feast at Jesus' table 
All the time.
He who fed the multitude,
Turned the water into wine,
To the hungry calleth now,
Come and dine. 

The disciples came to land,
Thus obeying Christ's command,
For the master called to them 
Come and dine.
There they found their hearts desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire
Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride,
To be ever at his side
All the host of Heaven
Will assembled be
O 'twill be a glorious sight, 
All the saints in spotless white 
And with Jesus they shall feast eternally.|2005-03-13T10:12:42|JESUS HAS A TABLE SPREAD, JESUS HAS A TABLE SPREAD,

The lamb was slain,
But he rose again.

To see Christ crucified,
But he rose, he rose again.

He healed the blind,
Yes he turned the water into wine.
He opened prison doors,
To set the captives free,
Yes he died for you and me.

They sent Christ to the cross, 
Yes they pierced him in the side.
But he said, "I'll come again".
And the world won't be the same,
Yes, he died for you and me.|2005-03-13T10:09:25|HE WALKED IN GALILEE, HE WALKED IN GALILEE,

Pardon there was multiplied to me, 
There my burdened soul found liberty,
At Calvary.

Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul, imploring turned
To Calvary.

Now I gladly own Him as my King, 
Now my raptured soul can only sing,
Of Calvary.
