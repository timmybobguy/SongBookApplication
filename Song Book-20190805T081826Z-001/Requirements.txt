THINGS TO DO

-- Remove sound when enter is pressed in searchbar
-- Import / export needs to be fixed, or get it to open folder like intented 
-- Fix bug with deleting song from songlist, this could be because its deleted from the box and another piece of code is trying to look at it
-- Remake the load song list, have it so that the song list is displayed. Have a close button. Be able to select any song and play it.
-- Get project song text to be centered with the left alignment
-- Put paragraph numbers when presenting e.g. 1-4, 2-4, etc. Bottom right
