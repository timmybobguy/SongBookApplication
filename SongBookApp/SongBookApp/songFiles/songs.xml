For He's done so very much for me.

Down on my knees, I found the Lord.
Not on a mountain, nor in a valley, 
But on my knees, I found the Lord.</body>

Down on my knees,

Shall renew their strength,
They shall mount up with wings as eagles,
They shall run and not be weary, 
They shall walk and not faint;
Teach me, Lord, Teach me, Lord, to wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait 
While hearts are aflame,
Help me humble my pride 
And call on Your Name;
Keep my faith renewed, 
Keep my eyes on thee,
Help me be on this earth 
What you want me to be.</body>

Calling, O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry 
When Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger 
And heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, 
The moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, 
Jesus is coming,
Coming for you and for me.

Oh! for the wonderful love 
He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Though we have sinned, 
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me.</body>

of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
Glory! Glory, hallelujah!
His Truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.</body>

Or to defend His cause;
Maintain the Honour of His Word,

CHORUS
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart, rolled away,
It was there by faith, 
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Jesus my Lord, I know His name
His name is all my trust,
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne, His promise stands,
And He can well secure
What I've commited to His hands,
Till the decisive hour.

Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father's face;
And in the New Jerusalem.
Appoint my soul a place.</body>

Singing as I go,
Pointing souls to Calvary 
To the crimson flow,
Many arrows pierce my soul
From without, within;
But my Lord leads me on,
Through Him I must win.

CHORUS
Oh I want to see Him, look upon His face,
There to sing forever, of His saving Grace;
On the streets of Glory let my lift my voice;
Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.

When in service for my lord,
Dark may be the night,
But i'll cling more close to him,
He will give me light,
Satans snares may vex my soul,
Turn my thoughts aside,
But my Lord goes ahead,
Leads whate'er betide.

When in valleys low I look,
Tward the mountain hieght,
And behold my saviour there,
Leading in the fight,
With a tender hand outstreched,
Tward the valley low,
Guiding me I can see as I onward go.

When before me billows rise,
From the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my barque,
He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on,
Through this world below,
He's a real friend to me,
O I love Him so.</body>

On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

Let us labor for the Master 
From the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous 
Love and care;
Then when all of life is over, 
And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder,

Stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross 
Where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

CHORUS
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross 
Till my trophies at last I lay down 
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Oh that old rugged cross 
So despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear Lamb of God
Left his glory above 
To bear it to dark Calvary

In that old rugged cross
Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see 
For 'twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me 

To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day
To my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share</body>

Now glory, grace and blessing
Mark the path I've trod

A fountain there is flowing deep and wide
The savior now invites you
To the water free
Where thirsting spirits can be satisfied</body>

Such love, such wondrous love,

That God should love a sinner such as I,
How wonderful is love like this.

That Christ should join so freely in the scheme,
Although it meant His death on Calvary,
Did ever human tongue find nobler theme,
Than love divine that ransomed me?

That for a willful outcast such as I,
The Father planned, the Savoir bled and died;
Redemption for a worthless slave to buy,
Who long had law and grace defied.

And now He calls me to His heart, a son,
He asks me not to fill a servants place,
The far off country wanderings are all done,
Wide open are His arms of grace.</body>

      <body>Onward, Christian soldiers! 
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who has gone before,
Christ, the royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See His banners go!

CHORUS
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

At the name of Jesus,
Satans host doth flee,
On then christian soildiers,
On to victory,
Hells foundations quiver,
At the shout of praise,
Brothers lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise, 
that can never fail.

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, praise, and honour, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing.</body>

Will your robes be white?
Pure and white in the blood

Will your soul be ready 
For the mansions bright,
Are you washed in the blood

Lay aside the garments 
That are stained by sin,
And be washed in the blood

There's a fountain flowing 
For the soul unclean,
Oh be washed in the blood

Tenderly mourned and wept:
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me, like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
Daily my cross for Thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, Oh Lord, with Thy desire,
For all who know not Thee:
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary.</body>

Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God to Thee;

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great
Thou art!</body>

Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When Jesus comes for me,
In power and majesty,
To take me home.
Blest saviour, then in love,
Fear and distrust remove,
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.</body>

That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care
I'm as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me!

There's no thirsting for the things
Of the world, they've taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away,
Now the Comforter abides with me!</body>

As you live in me 
And Lord renew my mind 
As your will unfolds in my life 
In living everyday
By the power of your love

Hold me close 
Let your love surround me 
Bring me near 
Draw me to your side 
And as I wait 
I'll rise up like an eagle 
And I will soar with you 
Your Spirit leads me on by the power of your love</body>

the Lord is on your side. 
Bear patiently the 
cross of grief or pain; 
leave to your God 
to order and provide; 
in every change God 
faithful will remain. 
Be still, my soul: your best,
your heavenly friend 
through thorny ways 
leads to a joyful end. 

Be still, my soul: 
your God will undertake 
to guide the future, 
as in ages past. 
Your hope, your confidence 
let nothing shake;
all now mysterious 
shall be bright at last. 
Be still, my soul: the waves 
and winds still know 
the Christ who ruled them 
while he dwelt below. 

Be still, my soul: 
the hour is hastening on 
when we shall be 
forever with the Lord, 
when disappointment, 
grief, and fear are gone, 
sorrow forgot, love's 
purest joys restored. 
Be still, my soul: when 
change and tears are past, 
all safe and blessed 
we shall meet at last.</body>

And at least a thousand times

But the reason why im broken
The reason Why I cry
Is how long must I wait to be with you

CHORUS
I close my eyes and I see your face
If home's where my heart is then i'm out of place
Lord won't you give me strenght 
To make it through somehow
I've never been more homesick then now

Help me Lord cause i don't understand your ways
The reason why, i wonder if i'l ever know
But even if you showed me the hurt would be the same
Cause i'm still here so far away from home

In christ there are no goodbyes
And in christ there is no end
So I hold on to Jesus with all that I have
To see you again
To see you again</body>

      <key />
      <body>In Christ alone my hope is found;
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all-
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied;
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid-
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine-
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death-
This is the pow'r of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home-
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.</body>

      <body>When troubles surround us, and they will come
the body grows weak and the spirit grows numb 
when these things beset us 
He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.

Noah had drifted, on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways;
troubles he had some,
but not from above 
God gave him His sign , 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.

Jesus our saviour, came to earth one day; 
He was born in a stable in a manger of hay 
though here rejected
but not from above 
God gave us his sign, 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.

When Jesus went down 
to the waters that day
he was baptised, in the usual way 
when it was done, God blessed his son, 
He sent Him His love 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.</body>

to the God of my childhood,
To the same simple faith
as a child I once knew;
Like the prodigal son
I have longed 
for my loved ones,
For the comforts of home
and the God I outgrew.

I have returned
to the God of my childhood,
Bethlehem's Babe,
the prophet's Messiah;
He's Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
With unfailing faith
for the child of her heart;
She said bring them up
the way that you want them, 
Thank God when they're grown,
they'll never depart.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
I learned at her knee
He's the lily of the valley; 
He's Jesus to me,
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my father,
The most God-like man
a child could know;
I just heard a shout
from the angels in glory,
Praising the Lord 
a child has come home.

I have returned 
to the God of my father,
Creator of heaven and earth, 
God of the universe;
He's Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned 
to the Yahweh of Judah,
On my knees I did fall 
where the wall now stands;
This lesson I learned 
as I've worked my way homeward,
The Saviour of all 
is a comfort to man. 

I have returned 
to the Father of Abraham, 
The shepherd of Moses 
who called Him the great I am; 
He's Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity; 
Praise His name, 
I have returned.</body>

      <key />
      <body>When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

His dying crimson, like a robe,
Spreads o'er His body on the tree;
Then I am dead to all the globe,
And all the globe is dead to me.

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.</body>

      <body>Do you know what it is 
not to have one guilty feeling, 
Not to wonder where you're
going when you die;
Not condemned of the past, 
Not afraid of what 
tomorrow holds in store
And know the reason why?

Yes, that's just how it is 
when you go down in the water
'Cause by faith you believe in 
what you heard,
It's no impossible dream,
you can start over clean
When you're washed
by the water of the Word.

Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?
Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?

It's like being born again 
with a whole new life to live,
Never having to look back 
to what you've been,
'Cause according to the Lord,
You've just started your existence,
And where He's concerned 
there never was no sin;

For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner
But a saint who's been washed
white as snow;
Not by any thing we've done
But by the blood of God's own Son.
Are you washed by the 
water of the Word?

Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?
Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?

Yes, I'm washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word.
Yes, I'm washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word.</body>

Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him

Now the blessed Holy Spirit
From the Father God above,
Has come down to earth
To claim His worthy bride.
And our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared his tents of love,
And he wants his fair Rebecca by his side.

We have left our kin folks gladly,
We have bid the world good-bye,
We are going to our home beyond the sky.
We shall soon behold our Isaac,
In our home beyond the sky,
What a happy, happy wedding that will be.

That will be a joyful meeting, 
When the camel train comes in,
Where our Isaac waits 
To meet his happy bride;
What a holy consummation,
What a glorious jubilee,
When we see the fair Rebecca by his side.</body>

Caring not my Lord was crucified,

Mercy there was great, and grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me, 
There my burdened soul found liberty,
At Calvary.

By God's Word at last my sin I learned,
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul, imploring turned
To Calvary.

Now I've given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King, 
Now my raptured soul can only sing,
Of Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan,
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man,
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span,
At Calvary.</body>

Come, my brother, seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy-bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;

How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be,
How marvelous! How wonderful!
Is my saviors love for me.

For me it was in the garden,
He prayed not my will, but thine.
He had no tears for his own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld him,
And came from the world of light.
To comfort him in his sorrows,
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them his very own.
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory,
His face I at last shall see.
Twill be my joy through the ages,
To sing of his love for me.</body>

Trust and obey,

To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But his smile quickly drives it away,
Not a doubt not a fear,
Not a sigh not a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay,
Not a grief not a loss,
Not a frown not a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove,
the delights of His love,
untill all on the alter we lay,
For the favour He shows,
and the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet,
we will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way,
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear only trust and obey.</body>

CHORUS
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted

In His love abiding,

And in Him confiding, 
I shall not be moved:
Just like a tree that's planted

I shall not be moved.

Jesus is my Saviour, 
I shall not be moved;
In His love and favor, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted

I shall not be moved.

Though all hell assail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Though the tempest rages, 
I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, 
I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted 
by the waters,
I shall not be moved.</body>

Where we'll never die,
There the sainted millions never say goodbye,
There we'll meet our saviour,
And our loved ones too,
Come O holy spirit,
All our hopes renew.

Here in dissapointment often we so sadly roam,
And earthly friends no longer speak one word of love,
But truly we have found contentment 
Jesus promised us a home,
So we are looking for a city  built above.

In this land of dangers we are going here and there,
We're simply trusting in the blessed saviours love,
And mercy tho we may be strangers 
Living in this world of care,
We're always looking for a city built above.</body>

He made all the darkness depart.

Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
When at the cross,
The saviour made me whole,
My sins were washed away,
And my night was turned to day,
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Born of the spirit with life from above,
Into Gods family divine,
Justified fully through Calvary's love,
O what a standing is mine,
And the transaction so quickly was made,
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace he did proffer,
He saved me praise His deer name.

Now I've a hope that will surely endure,
after the passing of time,
I have a future in heaven for sure,
there in those mansions sublime 
And it's because of that wonderful day,
When at the cross I believed,
Riches eternal and blessings supernal,
From His precvious hand I recieve.</body>

With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you

Your reward in Heaven 
Nor your home on high.

Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged

Jesus whispers sweet and low
Fear not I am with you peace be still 
In all of life's ebb and flow.

CHORUS
Jesus Jesus Jesus, 
Sweetest name I know
Fills my every longing 
Keeps me singing as I go.

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept away the broken strings
Stirred the slumbering chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

Though sometimes He leads 
Through waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
The path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.</body>

Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on Heaven's table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell 
Where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.</body>

When the redeemed 
Are gathering in,
Washed like snow, 
And free from all sin;
How we'll shout, 
And how we'll sing,
When the redeemed 
Are gathering in.

There will be a great procession 
Over on the streets of gold,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Oh what music, Oh what singing, 
O'er the city will be rolled,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption's story 
With their voices clear and strong,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
Then the angels all will listen, 
For they cannot join that song,
When the redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders 
To prepare the banquet board,
When the redeemed are gathering in;
And we'll hear His invitation, 
"Come, ye blessed of the Lord,"
When the redeemed are gathering in.</body>

Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Could my tears forever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone:
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

Not the labours of my hands,
Can fulfil thy laws demands,
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save and thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to thy cross I cling,
Naked come to thee for dress,
Helpless look to thee for grace,
Foul I to the fountian fly,
Wash me saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.</body>

And all our love is due Him,

Beneath the clensing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing,
How He made the lame to walk again,
And He caused the blind to see,
And then I cryed "Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit",
And somehow Jesus came,
And brought to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion,
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold,
Beyond the crystal sea,
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day i'll sing up there,
The song of victory.</body>

Who will all our sorrows share?

Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?

In His arms He'll take and shield thee,

The seventh seal is unveiled
The Original Life, the Original Seed.

We are the Word made flesh today
This is what the Scriptures say.
And our names are seen within,
Redeemed and perfect without sin.
Yes, we are anointed and inspired
By our God, Who's the Original Life.

We are called unto adoption
Full authority and power.
Sleeping saints will wake and join us
For translation in this hour.
Gentiles' days will soon be over
Glory, hallelujah!
To our God, Who's the Original Life.</body>

      <key />
      <body>Amazing grace! 
How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, 
But now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught 
My heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did 
That grace appear
The hour I first believed;

Thro' many dangers, 
Toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
Me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we've been 
There ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days 
To sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God,
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God, Praise God, 
Praise God,</body>

      <body>Living for Jesus is the best life of all,
Serving and following Him,
Living the worldly life is no life at all.
I know it since Jesus came in,
Nothing can satisfy like Jesus within.
He makes my happy heart sing,
Walking the saviours way,
Happy in modern days,
Living for Jesus my king.</body>

      <body>Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Thou are the Potter;
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me.</body>

      <body>I am Thine, oh Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
Nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
To Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
With a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
And with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
That I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
That I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.</body>

      <body>Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calvary's mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.</body>

      <key />
      <body>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see-
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</body>

      <title>When they Ring the Golden Bells</title>
      <key />
      <body>There's a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore by faith's decree;
One by one we'll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

 
Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

We shall know no sin or sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing,
Of our Father's sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
And in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit to be free,
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Eden,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.


Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.</body>
