Teach me, Lord, Teach me, Lord, to wait.

Help me humble my pride 
And call on Your Name;

Keep my eyes on thee,
Help me be on this earth

Glory! Glory, hallelujah!

I have seen Him in the watchfires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment seat;
Oh be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.</Body>

There to sing forever, of His saving Grace;
On the streets of Glory let my lift my voice;

Dark may be the night,
But i&apos;ll cling more close to him,
He will give me light,
Satans snares may vex my soul,
Turn my thoughts aside,
But my Lord goes ahead,
Leads whate&apos;er betide.

When in valleys low I look,
Tward the mountain hieght,
And behold my saviour there,
Leading in the fight,
With a tender hand outstreched,
Tward the valley low,
Guiding me I can see as I onward go.

When before me billows rise,
From the mighty deep,
Then my Lord directs my barque,
He doth safely keep,
And He leads me gently on,
Through this world below,
He&apos;s a real friend to me,
O I love Him so.</Body>

For the dear Lamb of God
Left his glory above 
To bear it to dark Calvary

Stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see 
For &apos;twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me

<Key></Key>
<Body>Onward, Christian soldiers! 
Marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus,
Who has gone before,
Christ, the royal Master, 
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See His banners go!

CHORUS
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

At the name of Jesus,
Satans host doth flee,
On then christian soildiers,
On to victory,
Hells foundations quiver,
At the shout of praise,
Brothers lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.

Like a mighty army 
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading 
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, 
All one body we;
One in hope and doctrine, 
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus 
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never 
&apos;Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ&apos;s own promise, 
that can never fail.

Onward, then ye people! 
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices 
In the triumph song;
Glory, praise, and honour, 
Unto Christ the King;
This thro&apos; countless ages 
Men and angels sing.</Body>

Come with a gift to Thee:
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

Daily my cross for Thee:

When through the woods,
And forest glades I wander
And hear the birds, 
Sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down,
From lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, 
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died, 
To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
With shout of acclamation
And take me home, 
What joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow, 
In humble adoration
And there proclaim, 
My God, how great

Let my heart be changed, renewed
Flowing from the grace

And lord i&apos;ve come to know 
The weaknesses i see in me
Will be stripped away 
By the power of your love

Bring me near 
Draw me to your side

And I will soar with you

Let me see you face to face 
The knowledge of your love 
As you live in me

As your will unfolds in my life 
In living everyday

<Body>Be still, my soul:
the Lord is on your side. 
Bear patiently the 
cross of grief or pain; 
leave to your God 
to order and provide; 
in every change God 
faithful will remain. 
Be still, my soul: your best,
your heavenly friend 
through thorny ways 
leads to a joyful end. 

Be still, my soul: 
your God will undertake 
to guide the future, 
as in ages past. 
Your hope, your confidence 
let nothing shake;
all now mysterious 
shall be bright at last. 
Be still, my soul: the waves 
and winds still know 
the Christ who ruled them 
while he dwelt below. 

Be still, my soul: 
the hour is hastening on 
when we shall be 
forever with the Lord, 
when disappointment, 
grief, and fear are gone, 
sorrow forgot, love&apos;s 
purest joys restored. 
Be still, my soul: when 
change and tears are past, 
all safe and blessed 
we shall meet at last.</Body>

I&apos;ve heard a thousand times
And at least a thousand times
I&apos;ve rejoiced for you
But the reason why im broken
The reason Why I cry
Is how long must I wait to be with you

CHORUS
I close my eyes and I see your face
If home&apos;s where my heart is then i&apos;m out of place
Lord won&apos;t you give me strenght 
To make it through somehow
I&apos;ve never been more homesick then now

Help me Lord cause i don&apos;t understand your ways
The reason why, i wonder if i&apos;l ever know
But even if you showed me the hurt would be the same
Cause i&apos;m still here so far away from home

In christ there are no goodbyes
And in christ there is no end
So I hold on to Jesus with all that I have
To see you again
To see you again</Body>

<Title>In Christ Alone</Title>
<Key></Key>
<Body>In Christ alone my hope is found;
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all-
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied;
For ev&apos;ry sin on Him was laid-
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin&apos;s curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine-
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death-
This is the pow&apos;r of Christ in me;
From life&apos;s first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow&apos;r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home-
Here in the pow&apos;r of Christ I&apos;ll stand.</Body>

<Body>When troubles surround us, and they will come
the body grows weak and the spirit grows numb 
when these things beset us 
He doesn&apos;t forget us
He sends down His love 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.

Noah had drifted, on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways;
troubles he had some,
but not from above 
God gave him His sign , 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.

Jesus our saviour, came to earth one day; 
He was born in a stable in a manger of hay 
though here rejected
but not from above 
God gave us his sign, 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,
on the wings of a dove.

When Jesus went down 
to the waters that day
he was baptised, in the usual way 
when it was done, God blessed his son, 
He sent Him His love 
on the wings of a dove. 

On the wings of a snow white dove
God sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above,

<Body>I have returned 
to the God of my childhood,
To the same simple faith
as a child I once knew;
Like the prodigal son
I have longed 
for my loved ones,
For the comforts of home
and the God I outgrew.

I have returned
to the God of my childhood,
Bethlehem&apos;s Babe,
the prophet&apos;s Messiah;
He&apos;s Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
With unfailing faith
for the child of her heart;
She said bring them up
the way that you want them, 
Thank God when they&apos;re grown,
they&apos;ll never depart.

I have returned
to the God of my mother,
I learned at her knee
He&apos;s the lily of the valley; 
He&apos;s Jesus to me,
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned
to the God of my father,
The most God-like man
a child could know;
I just heard a shout
from the angels in glory,
Praising the Lord 
a child has come home.

I have returned 
to the God of my father,
Creator of heaven and earth, 
God of the universe;
He&apos;s Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, 
I have returned.

I have returned 
to the Yahweh of Judah,
On my knees I did fall 
where the wall now stands;
This lesson I learned 
as I&apos;ve worked my way homeward,
The Saviour of all 
is a comfort to man. 

I have returned 
to the Father of Abraham, 
The shepherd of Moses 
who called Him the great I am; 
He&apos;s Jesus to me, 
Eternal Deity; 
Praise His name, 
I have returned.</Body>

Fear not little flock
Whatever your lot
He enters all rooms,

He never forsakes,

So count on his presence

<Body>When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e&apos;er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

His dying crimson, like a robe,
Spreads o&apos;er His body on the tree;
Then I am dead to all the globe,
And all the globe is dead to me.

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.</Body>

Not condemned of the past, 
Not afraid of what 
tomorrow holds in store
And know the reason why?

Yes, that&apos;s just how it is

It&apos;s no impossible dream,
you can start over clean
When you&apos;re washed

Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?
Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?

It&apos;s like being born again 
with a whole new life to live,
Never having to look back 
to what you&apos;ve been,
&apos;Cause according to the Lord,
You&apos;ve just started your existence,
And where He&apos;s concerned 
there never was no sin;

For when God looks your way
He no longer sees a sinner
But a saint who&apos;s been washed
white as snow;
Not by any thing we&apos;ve done
But by the blood of God&apos;s own Son.
Are you washed by the 
water of the Word?

Are you washed by the water,
Washed by the water of the Word?
Are you washed by the water,

The camel train comes in.

Now the blessed Holy Spirit
From the Father God above,
Has come down to earth
To claim His worthy bride.
And our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared his tents of love,
And he wants his fair Rebecca by his side.

We have left our kin folks gladly,
We have bid the world good-bye,
We are going to our home beyond the sky.
We shall soon behold our Isaac,
In our home beyond the sky,
What a happy, happy wedding that will be.

That will be a joyful meeting,

Where our Isaac waits 
To meet his happy bride;
What a holy consummation,
What a glorious jubilee,
When we see the fair Rebecca by his side.</Body>

But he rose, he rose again.

He healed the lame,
He healed the blind,
Yes he turned the water into wine.
He opened prison doors,
To set the captives free,
Yes he died for you and me.

The Pharisees were lost, 
They sent Christ to the cross, 
Yes they pierced him in the side.
But he said, &quot;I&apos;ll come again&quot;.
And the world won&apos;t be the same,
Yes, he died for you and me.</Body>

At Calvary.

Then I trembled at the law I&apos;d spurned,
Till my guilty soul, imploring turned
To Calvary.

Now I gladly own Him as my King,

He prayed not my will, but thine.

But sweat drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld him,
And came from the world of light.
To comfort him in his sorrows,
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them his very own.
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.

His face I at last shall see.
Twill be my joy through the ages,

Trust and obey,
For there&apos;s no other way,
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a cloud in the skies,
But his smile quickly drives it away,
Not a doubt not a fear,
Not a sigh not a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay,
Not a grief not a loss,
Not a frown not a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove,
the delights of His love,
untill all on the alter we lay,
For the favour He shows,
and the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Or we&apos;ll walk by His side in the way,

Where He sends we will go,
Never fear only trust and obey.</Body>

<Body>We are gathered as the body of our Lord,
And we worship Him, in one accord,
For He does not dwell in temples made of stone,
He dwells within the hearts of men alone.

And we&apos;re the hands, we&apos;re the feet,
We&apos;re the ears, we&apos;re the eyes,
He&apos;s the head, Thru His blood we,
Are supplied.

And as our lives touch and,
Unions form,
That cannot be destroyed,
We are made visible,
The body of the Lord.</Body>

He heard a voice from heaven
And this is what it said:
I&apos;m the Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end;
Behold I live forevermore.

CHORUS
Behold I live, behold I live,
Behold I live forevermore,
Behold I live, behold I live,
Behold I live forever more.

Among the seven candlesticks,
I saw the risen Lord.
His eyes were as a flame of fire,
And from his mouth a sword.
As the voice of many waters,
Sounded forth the living word,
Behold I live forever more.</Body>

And earthly friends no longer speak one word of love,

And to her was granted that she shoud be,
Arrayed in fine linnens clean and white.

<Body>Oh what a wonderful wonderful day,
Day I will never forget.
After I wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my saviour I met.
O what a tender compassionate friend,
He met the need of my heart.
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart.

CHORUS
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
When at the cross,
The saviour made me whole,
My sins were washed away,
And my night was turned to day,
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Born of the spirit with life from above,
Into Gods family divine,
Justified fully through Calvary&apos;s love,
O what a standing is mine,
And the transaction so quickly was made,
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace he did proffer,
He saved me praise His deer name.

Now I&apos;ve a hope that will surely endure,
after the passing of time,
I have a future in heaven for sure,
there in those mansions sublime 
And it&apos;s because of that wonderful day,
When at the cross I believed,
Riches eternal and blessings supernal,
From His precvious hand I recieve.</Body>

Name them one by one,
Count your blessings 
See what God has done;
Count your blessings,

And it will surprise you 
What the Lord has done.

Are you ever burdened 
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy 
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings 
Every doubt will fly, 
And you will be singing 
As the days go by.

When you look at others 
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you 
His wealth untold,
Count your many blessings, 
Money cannot buy
Your reward in Heaven 
Nor your home on high.

Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged 
God is over all,
Count your many blessings 
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you

Fear not I am with you peace be still

Jesus Jesus Jesus, 
Sweetest name I know
Fills my every longing 
Keeps me singing as I go.

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept away the broken strings
Stirred the slumbering chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting &apos;neath His shelt&apos;ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

Though sometimes He leads 
Through waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
The path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.</Body>

Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;

In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

Not the labours of my hands,
Can fulfil thy laws demands,
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save and thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to thy cross I cling,
Naked come to thee for dress,
Helpless look to thee for grace,
Foul I to the fountian fly,
Wash me saviour, or I die.

When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

<Title>I Heard an old, old Story,</Title>
<Key></Key>
<Body>I heard an old, old story,
How the Saviour came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary,
To save a wretch like me,
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious bloods atoning,
Then I repented of my sins,
And won the victory.

CHORUS
Oh victory in Jesus,
My Saviour forever,
He sought me and He bought me,
With His redeeming blood,
He loved me ere and I knew Him,
And all our love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the clensing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing,
How He made the lame to walk again,
And He caused the blind to see,
And then I cryed &quot;Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit&quot;,
And somehow Jesus came,
And brought to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion,
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold,
Beyond the crystal sea,
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day i&apos;ll sing up there,
The song of victory.</Body>

Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our ev&apos;ry weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He&apos;ll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.</Body>

Redeemed and perfect without sin.

Full authority and power.

For translation in this hour.

After Thy will,
While I am waiting, 
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray!
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me,
Saviour divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o&apos;er my being
Absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me.</Body>

<Title>I am Thine, oh Lord,</Title>
<Key></Key>
<Body>I am Thine, oh Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice;
And it told Thy love to me.
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

CHORUS
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, 
Nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now, 
To Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up 
With a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour,
That before Thy throne I spend;
When I kneel in prayer, 
And with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love 
That I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy 
That I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.</Body>

<Title>Jesus, Keep me Near the Cross,</Title>

<Body>Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream,
Flows from Calvary&apos;s mountain.

CHORUS
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o&apos;er me.

Near the cross I&apos;ll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.</Body>

<Title>Abide with me</Title>
<Key></Key>
<Body>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life&apos;s little day;
Earth&apos;s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see-
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter&apos;s pow&apos;r?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death&apos;s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;
Heav&apos;n&apos;s morning breaks, and earth&apos;s vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</Body>

<Title>When they Ring the Golden Bells</Title>
<Key></Key>
<Body>There&apos;s a land beyond the river,
That we call the sweet forever,
And we only reach that shore by faith&apos;s decree;
One by one we&apos;ll gain the portals,
There to dwell with the immortals,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

 
Don&apos;t you hear the bells now ringing?
Don&apos;t you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

We shall know no sin or sorrow,
In that haven of tomorrow,
When our barque shall sail beyond the silver sea;
We shall only know the blessing,
Of our Father&apos;s sweet caressing,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

Don&apos;t you hear the bells now ringing?
Don&apos;t you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

When our days shall know their number,
And in death we sweetly slumber,
When the King commands the spirit to be free,
Nevermore with anguish laden,
We shall reach that lovely Eden,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.


Don&apos;t you hear the bells now ringing?
Don&apos;t you hear the angels singing?
Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee,
In that far-off sweet forever,
Just beyond the shining river,
When they ring the golden bells for you and me.</Body>
